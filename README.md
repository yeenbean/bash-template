A simple starting place for new Bash scripts. This script:

- uses `/usr/bin/env bash` for portability
- uses the unofficial
[Bash Strict Mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)
- checks that bash 4 is executing the script

## Issues

The issues tracker contains both issues and feature requests. There are
templates available if you're not sure how to submit your issue.

### Issues for Newcomers

Occasionally, I will mark simple issues with the **good first issue** label so
that newcomers to `git` can learn the ropes. If you're new, please check these
out to get your hands dirty!

If you have absolutely no experience to the `git` workflow, or you need a
refresher, check out [this site](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) made
by [rogerdudler](https://github.com/rogerdudler)!
